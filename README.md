## Requirements
- Python 3.x (I used Python 3.11)
- A valid CoinMarketCap API key , You can use the current API key but if you'd like you can download a free API key @ [CoinMarket Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
- Required Python libraries:
    - requests
    - json
    - os
    - locale
    - Datetime
    - Prettytable
    - Colorama

## Getting Started 
Follow these steps to set up and run my Crypto Market Data App on your local machine .

1. Clone the repository to your local machine   
``` git clone https://github.com/Kurtm36/crypto-market-tracker.git```

2.  Navigate to the project directory
   
    ```cd crypto-market-tracker```

3. Install the required Python libraries using pip

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Configuration

1. Open the `env.py` file in the project directory.
2. Replace `API_KEY` with your actual CoinMarketCap API key.
3. Save the file.

## Running the App
1. Execute the run.py file

    ```python3 run.py ```

2. The terminal will display the main menu. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.  

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to explore different features of the app.


## Deployment

- Steps for deployment 
  - Fork or clone this repository
  - Create a new Heroku app
  - Set the buildbacks for Python and NodesJS in that order 
  - Link the Heroku app to the repository
  - Click on deploy

### Testing 
- I ran my program through the CI Python linter and recieved the  all clear with no errors found

- I tested different inputs and invalid inputs to see If I could break my program.
- I tested the App on command prompt aswell as other terminals 

### Bugs
- In the file coincap_ranker_func.py, I resolved the issue where the price was matching the market cap incorrectly. This problem was addressed by correcting the variable assignments at lines 97 and 100, where the variables market_cap and volume had been inadvertently swapped.

- In the coincap_listing/quotes_func.py, I identified and fixed a formatting issue where percent changes were being displayed as EURO instead of percentages. The correction involved revising the formatting of the string_percent variable and related components.

- In future_value_func.py, I mitigated an issue with data iteration in the API by setting the encoding to 'utf-8-sig'. This change allowed the API to iterate through the data as intended.
  
- In the same future_value_func.py file, I rectified an error where "total_supply" was mistakingly used instead of "circulating supply" for the available_supply variable
